# Grocery Price Comparison App

This project scrapes grocery prices from local grocery chains based on Zip Code and locatable Chains
For testing this, we implemented this app with Walmart, Giant, Safeway, and Aldi as test cases for Grocery chains

Scrapers are set up to create datasets on Grocery Chain prices with the applied Zip Code, both for each store as a .csv

Then merges them with fuzzy matching and provides:
- Cheapest store for each item
- Shopping cart total comparison
- Full Streamlit web interface
